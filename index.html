                        <p>Dear dad,</p>
                        <p>Happy birthday!</p>
                        <p>
                            Over the past year, I feel like I’ve gotten to know you on a much deeper level. 
                            I’ve become much more adept at following and expanding on your logic, and as I 
                            mentioned to you before, a lot of things that you’ve always emphasized (and which 
                            I didn’t understand why before) have become apparent to me. I’m very grateful for 
                            having someone who is willing and eager to teach me everything they know and anything 
                            I wish to learn.
